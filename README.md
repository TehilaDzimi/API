# ApiEx01
Welcome to my first WEB Api site, and thank you for reading this file.

Description:
The project represents a house store.
This project is a website developed using Web API technology in .NET 7. It follows the principles of a REST API and ensures compliance with industry standards.

Key Features:

Web API: The project is built using Web API technology, providing a robust and scalable approach to building APIs.

REST API Compliance: The project adheres to the standards of a RESTful API, ensuring interoperability and ease of integration.

Zxcvbn Library Integration: The project incorporates the Zxcvbn library, which is a password strength checker, to enhance the security of user passwords.

Layered Architecture: The project follows a layered architecture approach, where different layers communicate with each other through Dependency Injection (DI). This promotes code organization, maintainability, and testability.

SQL Server Database: The project utilizes SQL Server as the database technology, offering powerful data storage and retrieval capabilities.

Asynchronous Operations: To optimize performance and scalability, the project utilizes asynchronous programming techniques to interact with the server.

ORM with Entity Framework: The project leverages the Entity Framework, a popular Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool, to connect with the database. This allows for efficient data access and manipulation.

Database-First Approach: The project adopts the Database-First approach, which means it integrates with an existing database schema. This simplifies development and maintenance.

Swagger-OpenAPI for Server Testing: The project integrates Swagger-OpenAPI for server-side testing, ensuring that the API endpoints are well-documented and can be easily tested.

Data Transfer Objects (DTO): The project utilizes a DTO layer to facilitate the creation and transfer of objects. A mapper is used to map the DTOs to the corresponding domain objects.

Configuration Files: Configuration files are used to store data that may change, providing flexibility and easy maintenance.

Logging: The project ensures proper logging to capture important events and facilitate troubleshooting and debugging.


Project Setup:

To run the project, please follow the instructions below:

1. Install Visual Studio 2022: Make sure you have Visual Studio 2022 installed on your system.

2. Database Setup: Set up a SQL Server instance and configure the connection string in the project's configuration files.

3. Code-First Approach: To work with the SQL database, use the Code-
